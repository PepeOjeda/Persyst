Persyst is a runtime serialization plugin for Unity.

It's not quite a deployment-ready save system, but rather a toolset with which to build your own, as simple or complex as you want it to be. 

That being said, very little code (or even none) is required to make a simple save system out of it (mostly just tagging fields with attributes).

[For a far more detailed explanation of what this is all about, see the docs](https://pepeojeda.github.io/persyst-docs/).
